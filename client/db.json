      "body": "Even though From My Bowl is a relatively new blog in the online vegan community, she’s established herself as a reliable voice for vegans who want to follow a plant-based and cruelty-free diet that isn’t pricey or bland, but who also know the importance of treating yourself once in a while.\n\nAside from dishing out some lovely vegan recipes, many of my From My Bowl’s recipes cater to certain dietary needs, like being grain-free or gluten-free.  From My Bowl also occasionally features vegan lifestyle advice and reviews, such as food diaries from her travels and wellness tips as a vegan.",
